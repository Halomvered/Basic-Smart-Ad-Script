# Basic-recommended-content-Script

Basic groundwork for a recommended content script.

It collects all of the words used in the images "Alt", main headers, the "Description" and "Keywords" meta tags. Then it filters out of them the 100 most used words in english(that are not potential keywords).

It organizes them by most frequency of appearence in the site.

Then it places above the Footer 4 content boxes that specify the first and second most used words on the page.


(Plans for the future: Add a 'Not intrested in this content' button - that will make the recommended content move on to the next keyword + saving the user preference in a cookie, for future reference.)



Please be aware that the point of recommended content injection must be customized for each individual website!
