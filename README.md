# Basic-recommended-content-Script

Javascript mini-project for my portfolio.

It collects all of the words used in the images "Alt", headers, the "Description" and "Keywords" meta tags of a webpage. Then it filters out of them the 100 most used words in english(that are not potential keywords).

It then organizes them by most frequency of appearence in the site, and creates a popup window that presents the 4 most repeated words in the elements stated above.


Feel free to copy the code and paste it to the console of the homepage of any site, to see how it works!
